INTRODUCTION 
     Welcome to the Stratosphere! Our new application, "The Restful Realm," is taking the concept of a furniture store to the clouds.

     ​The team's objective is to prototype the complete Sign-In and multi-step Sign-Up user flow, ensuring a seamless journey to accessing our collection of "weightless wonders." This critical flow must include the standard credentials screen with a simulated "Forgot Passwor" link, and a minimum three-step registration process, complete with necessary validation checks to confirm our users' "Celestial Identities."

TECHNOLOGY STACK

    The prototype is built using a simple and responsive frontend. 
    It focuses on clarity, usability, and smooth interaction.

    • HTML5 – Provides the structure and layout of the pages.
    • CSS3 – Handles styling, formatting, and responsive design.
    • JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the interface.
