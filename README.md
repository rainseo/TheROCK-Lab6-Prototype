# TheR.O.C.K. Laboratory 6 Prototype
## Welcome to the Stratosphere!
Our new website, **The Restful Realm ☁**, is taking the concept of a furniture store to the clouds.

​The team's objective is to prototype the complete **Sign-In and multi-step Sign-Up user flow**, ensuring a seamless journey to accessing our collection of _"weightless wonders."_ This critical flow must include the standard credentials screen with a simulated "Forgot Password" link, and a minimum three-step registration process, complete with necessary validation checks to confirm our users' *"Celestial Identities."*
